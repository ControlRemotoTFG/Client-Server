Client is implemented using JAVA . 
For now, we are testing the QR implementation to start connections between client and server.

Default port 54000 and it takes your IP automatically.


TODO IN THIS QR PART:

- SERVER DOESN'T BLOCK IN RECEIVE CALL.
- WHEN THE CLIENT CONNECTS, SERVER MUST GIVE THE OPTION TO CHOOSE THE TYPE OF JOYSTICK.
- WHEN THE CLIENT CONNECTS, HE MUST SEND HIS RESOLUTION TO THE SERVER.
